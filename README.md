# Unemployment-Analysis-using-Python

!!!Hello Folks!!!

Let me give you a brief introduction about this project

Well first of all I would like to My Professor Dr. Sudeepan for giving me an opputunity to work on this Minor project where I learnt new analysis tools like Python, Pandas, Numoy, seaborn. This project basically analyzes data of the Unemployment rate of different states of India before Covid 19 and after covid 19 and based on that data we conclude various information like Most adversely affected states, Poorest state etc.


Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people
who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp
increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19.

Dataset has also been provided for your reference.
